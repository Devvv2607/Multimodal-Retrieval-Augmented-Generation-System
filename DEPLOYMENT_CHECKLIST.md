# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Checklist

This checklist helps ensure successful deployment of the Multimodal RAG System on Streamlit Cloud.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Repository Preparation
- [ ] Fork the repository to your GitHub account
- [ ] Verify repository structure is correct
- [ ] Check that `streamlit_app.py` is in the root directory
- [ ] Verify all required files are present

### 2. Requirements Verification
- [ ] Check `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt` for Streamlit Cloud deployment
- [ ] Ensure all core dependencies are listed
- [ ] Remove any packages that might cause issues on Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Verify package versions are compatible

### 3. Configuration Check
- [ ] Review `config.yaml` for appropriate settings
- [ ] Ensure paths are relative and portable
- [ ] Check model names are correct and publicly accessible
- [ ] Verify performance settings are appropriate for cloud deployment

### 4. Code Review
- [ ] Ensure all imports have proper error handling
- [ ] Check that optional features gracefully degrade
- [ ] Verify file paths use relative references
- [ ] Confirm temporary files are handled correctly

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Streamlit Cloud Setup
- [ ] Sign in to Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Click "New app"
- [ ] Select your forked repository
- [ ] Set branch to "main" (or your preferred branch)
- [ ] Set "Main file path" to `streamlit_app.py`
- [ ] Choose a memorable app name
- [ ] Click "Deploy!"

### 2. Requirements Configuration
- [ ] In app settings, verify requirements file is set correctly
- [ ] If using custom requirements, specify `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt`
- [ ] Check build logs for any dependency issues

### 3. Environment Variables
- [ ] Set any required environment variables in the "Secrets" section
- [ ] Common variables:
  - `MODEL_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/models` (if needed)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Initial Testing
- [ ] Verify the app loads without errors
- [ ] Check that all tabs are accessible
- [ ] Test basic functionality with a small sample file
- [ ] Verify error handling works correctly

### 2. Feature Verification
- [ ] Test text document processing (TXT, DOCX, PDF)
- [ ] Check if image processing is available (if CLIP is installed)
- [ ] Verify audio processing works (if Whisper is installed)
- [ ] Test the chat interface with a simple question

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor app loading times
- [ ] Check memory usage during file processing
- [ ] Verify model loading works correctly
- [ ] Test with various file sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Build Failures
- **Symptom**: App fails to build
- **Solution**: 
  - Check build logs for specific error messages
  - Simplify requirements file
  - Remove packages that require compilation

#### 2. Import Errors
- **Symptom**: "Module not found" errors
- **Solution**:
  - Verify all required packages are in requirements file
  - Check package names and versions
  - Ensure dependencies are correctly specified

#### 3. Memory Issues
- **Symptom**: App crashes or becomes unresponsive
- **Solution**:
  - The system is already configured for CPU-only operation
  - Use smaller models in config.yaml
  - Process smaller files or fewer files at once

#### 4. Model Download Problems
- **Symptom**: Long loading times or timeout errors
- **Solution**:
  - First load may take several minutes due to model downloads
  - Subsequent loads should be faster due to caching
  - Check internet connectivity

#### 5. Optional Feature Issues
- **Symptom**: Image or audio processing not working
- **Solution**:
  - This is expected on Streamlit Cloud due to package limitations
  - The system gracefully degrades to text-only functionality
  - Users will see appropriate warnings

## Optimization Tips

### 1. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Use smaller models for better performance
- [ ] Limit batch sizes to reduce memory usage
- [ ] Process files in smaller chunks
- [ ] Cache frequently used data

### 2. User Experience
- [ ] Add clear loading indicators for long operations
- [ ] Provide informative error messages
- [ ] Include usage instructions and examples
- [ ] Implement proper file size warnings

### 3. Resource Management
- [ ] Clean up temporary files after processing
- [ ] Monitor and limit memory usage
- [ ] Use efficient data structures
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

## Maintenance

### 1. Updates
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub repository
- [ ] Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy
- [ ] Monitor deployment for any issues
- [ ] Test new features after deployment

### 2. Monitoring
- [ ] Regularly check Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- [ ] Monitor usage statistics
- [ ] Review error logs for issues
- [ ] Check for dependency updates

### 3. Scaling
- [ ] Streamlit Cloud automatically scales
- [ ] Consider usage patterns
- [ ] Plan for traffic spikes
- [ ] Upgrade to paid plan if needed
